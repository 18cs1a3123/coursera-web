    <h1>GITBOOK</h1>
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p class="big">
      This chapter will be about getting started with Git. We will begin by explaining some background
on version control tools, then move on to how to get Git running on your system and finally how to
get it set up to start working with. At the end of this chapter you should understand why Git is
around, why you should use it and you should be all set up to do so.

    <h2>About Version Control</h2>
    <div class="big">
      What is “version control”, and why should you care? Version control is a system that records
changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. For the
examples in this book, you will use software source code as the files being version controlled,
though in reality you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer.
If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which
you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use. It
allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a
previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing
a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if
you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little
overhead.

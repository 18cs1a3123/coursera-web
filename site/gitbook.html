    <h1>GITBOOK</h1>
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p class="big">
      This chapter will be about getting started with Git. We will begin by explaining some background
on version control tools, then move on to how to get Git running on your system and finally how to
get it set up to start working with. At the end of this chapter you should understand why Git is
around, why you should use it and you should be all set up to do so.
    </p>
    <h2>About Version Control</h2>
    <div class="big">
      What is “version control”, and why should you care? Version control is a system that records
changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. For the
examples in this book, you will use software source code as the files being version controlled,
though in reality you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer.
If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which
you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use. It
allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a
previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing
a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if
you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little
overhead.

    <h2>Local version control system</h2>
    <article>
      <p>Many people’s version-control method of choice is to copy files into another directory (perhaps a
time-stamped directory, if they’re clever). This approach is very common because it is so simple, but
it is also incredibly error prone. It is easy to forget which directory you’re in and accidentally write
to the wrong file or copy over files you don’t mean to.</p>
    </article>
    <p>To deal with this issue, programmers long ago developed local VCSs that had a simple database that
kept all the changes to files under revision control.</p>
<article>
  <div>
    <p>One of the most popular VCS tools was a system called RCS, which is still distributed with many
computers today. RCS works by keeping patch sets (that is, the differences between files) in a special
format on disk; it can then re-create what any file looked like at any point in time by adding up all
the patches.</p>

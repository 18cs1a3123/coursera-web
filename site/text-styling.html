	<h1>What is Git?</h1>
	<p>Git doesn’t think of or store its data this way. Instead, Git thinks of its data more like a series of
snapshots of a miniature filesystem. With Git, every time you commit, or save the state of your
project, Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a
reference to that snapshot. To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesn’t store the file again,
just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. Git thinks about its data more like a
stream of snapshots.</p>
<p class="style">This is an important distinction between Git and nearly all other VCSs. It makes Git reconsider
almost every aspect of version control that most other systems copied from the previous
generation. This makes Git more like a mini filesystem with some incredibly powerful tools built on
top of it, rather than simply a VCS. We’ll explore some of the benefits you gain by thinking of your
data this way when we cover Git branching in Git Branching.</p>

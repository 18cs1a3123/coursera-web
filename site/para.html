	<h4>Green Revolution</h4>
	<p>Food security was one of the most important issues that gripped policy makers in the years immediately after India's independence. At that time, acheiving self-sufficiency in foodgrains production became the primary concern of the government. Today, India is self-sufficient in foodgrains production, and to a large extent, has been able to assure food security to millions of its citizens. For this phenomenal acheivement, the credit in large measure should go to the Green Revolution.</p>
	<h4>What was it</h4>
	<div>In early 1960s, age-old agricultural practices began to be replaced by modern farm practices. These modern farm practices included high yeilding varieties of seeds, increased use of fertilizers, and assured water supply with improved irrigation facilities(like wells and canals). Such practices were given the collective title of the <b>Green Revolution</b>.</div>
	<div>The program was started with the help of the United States-based Rockfeller Foundation and was based on high yeilding varieties of rice,wheat, and other grains that had been developed in different parts of the world. The most important thrust of the green revolution was to demonstrate to the farmer how productivity could be raised without increasing the area under cultivation.</div>
